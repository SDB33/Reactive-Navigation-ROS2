#Reactive-Navigation-ROS2
Implementation of the Potential Fields technique

This project is part of the practical assignments for the Robotics course. It has been implemented with a strong emphasis on obstacle avoidance, prioritizing safety over direct path following. The laser readings are weighted, giving higher importance to angles closer to the direction formed by the robot's current position and the target position.
